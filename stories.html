		<h1 id="the_story">The story about the appearance of Minsk!</h1>
	    <p><img id="minskfoto" src="img/minsk.png" alt="" align="left">
	 <div id="textalign"><h3><p>History stores two main legends of the origin of Minsk. Each of them is distinguished by a beautiful narrative and a contender for the role of the main one. In fact, no one can determine what exactly caused these names to appear.</p></h3></div></p> </br>
	 <h3 id="pravo"><p>
		The first legend is dedicated to the healer by the name of Menesk. By the way, this is the name that first appears in The Tale of Bygone Years when the sons of Yaroslav the Wise arrived at the city walls to capture him. But much earlier in the settlement erected on the Svisloch River, the aforementioned healer erected a large stone mill.
		Locals considered him a real hero. Basically, the young man was engaged in grinding grain. He rarely came out to people. Because of this, there were a lot of rumors about him. Some believed that the mill on Svisloch was grinding a stone instead of a zhita, while others supposedly heard screaming and music at night. Some of the settlers were convinced that at night, Menesk walked around the village and gathered the most daring and courageous in his retinue. Of these, a people subsequently came about who began to bear the name of their leader.
	</p></h3>
	</br>
	<h3 id="pravo"><p>
		The second, more popular, legend is dedicated to artisans and merchants who began to gather at the fair in a convenient location on the Svisloch River. Initially, settlements were not made, instead of them, a convenient way of trading was the exchange of goods (barter). It is believed that this word became the basis in the origin of the name of the <div class="otstup">settlement - Mensk. A little later, the city began to be called Minsk. Given the fact that for a long time the settlement was part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, it was called Minsk-Lithuanian. Subsequently, after the separation of the Belarusian lands: Minsk-Belarus. In its modern form, the name without prefix is ​​used - Minsk (Minsk - in Belarusian).

		<h1 id="the_story">The story about the appearance of Vitebsk!</h1>
	    <p><img id="minskfoto" src="img/vitebsk.png" alt="" align="left">
	 <div id="textalign" class="pravo"><h3><p>
		Each city has its own story, the story of the name of the settlement. Vitebsk got its name thanks to the Vitbe River (the left tributary of the Western Dvina River).</p></h3></div></p> </br>
	 <h3 id="pravo"><p>
		The story of Vitba herself begins in the distant past. And there is a very beautiful legend, a legend about a girl, although there are still a couple of other versions about the origin of the Vitba river itself.
	</p></h3>
	</br>
	<h3 id="pravo"><p>
		So, in order. Version One:	</p></h3>
	</br>
	<h3 id="pravo"><p>
		In the distant past, a tribe descended from the Black Mountains, fled, hurried somewhere. In this tribe lived one lovely creature named Radunitsa. Having a charming beauty and mind, she wanted to know everything, everything was interesting. The forest in those days was so magnificent that one could say about it: “He is alive!”. Admiring him, the girl stopped, considering everything that was happening in this forest.After some period of time, she came to her senses, but it was already too late - there was nobody around. The sun had already set, the moon was shining. The girl was frightened, cried, and in desperation, she began to wind between trees, bushes, hills and fields in the hope of finding her tribe. She cried so much that her tears did not have time to dry out on the ground. And over time, a stream began to run after it, and then the river itself. Since then, the river has been spinning in girlish footsteps, like lace, curls in a twist, bends and turns <div id="plaren">out on turns.</div>
	</p></h3>
	</br>
	<h3 id="pravo"><p>
		<div class="otstup2">The second version: it is taken from a forgotten landscape concept of twist, the definition of which is a damp place or swamp. The prefix "ba" itself </div><div class="otstup">means nothing more than the attachment itself to the place where this river flows. This version is considered more relevant, basic.
		</div></p></h3>
	</br>
	<h3 id="pravo"><p>
		<div class="otstup2">Another version was presented in the 19th century. local historian Sapunov Alexei Parfenovich, originally from Vitebsk. According to his convictions, the </div><div class="otstup">city of Vitebsk has exclusively Slavic roots, and the word itself comes from the verb. 
		</div></p></h3>

			<h1 id="the_story">The story about the appearance of Mogilev!</h1>
	    <p><img id="minskfoto" src="img/mogilev.png" alt="" align="left">
	 <div id="textalign" class="pravo"><h3><p>
		It is believed that Mogilev got its current name as a result of a similar designation of the place where ataman Mashek was buried in his time. The noble robber was distinguished by courage and uncommon strength. There was a rumor throughout the district that the heroic power that nature had endowed him helped him cope with all his enemies. He himself was like a lion: strong and domineering. People said that the chieftain could pull up trees with the root. However, the life course allotted to him was reduced not by the beast, not by another robber, but by a woman. He became a victim of deceit. The place where he was buried began to be called the tomb of a lion. Contemporaries got the derived name "Mogilev".</p></h3></div></p>

	<h1 id="the_story">The story about the appearance of Gomel!</h1>
	    <p><img id="minskfoto" src="img/gomel.png" alt="" align="left">
	 <div id="textalign" class="pravo"><h3><p>
		In the very place where the city is now located, on the Sozh River there used to be too much washed sand. Rafts and barges passing along this river could run aground, and to prevent this from happening, a man was constantly on the shore opposite this place, and shouted loudly, warning: “Go! Stranded! Go! Stranded!</p></h3></div></p> 
	<h3 id="pravo"><p>
		There is also an opinion that the town was given the name by the Gomeyuk brook, which flowed into the Sozh River at the foot of the mound, it was believed that it was there that the first settlement was once formed. And the word Gomeyuk comes from the Finnish hommo joki "fast river".</p></h3>
	</br>
	<h3 id="pravo"><p>
		The city itself has considerable urban legends and signs. For example, the fact that you can be charged with fortune throughout the city, and it will be as easy as charging a phone. At the railway station, a genre sculpture “Road mood” was installed - a traveler sitting on a suitcase. And according to popular belief, if you rub his nose, then you are guaranteed a good mood and (or) success during the trip. In Gomel, there is also a sign for students: it is possible to recharge with success with the help of the subject "Students". They don’t forget to rub themselves on the “Pencil”, too, that, near the circus, they say, a good omen ...</p></h3>
	</br>
	<h3 id="pravo"><p>
		Also, most newlyweds try to stay at the “Boatman” on the day of marriage, many climb into the boat itself, believing that <div id="plaren">this will definitely fix their marriage, and if you still know in what places to hang up the castle, then everything is sure to be a triumph.</div></p></h3>
	</br>
	<h3 id="pravo"><p>
		<div class="otstup2">In this mysterious city, for example, fans of the Soligorsk football team Shakhtar are charged with luck, having visited the sculpture “Moles”, which is</div> <div class="otstup">located near the “October” cinema.</div>
	</p></h3>
	</br>
	<h3 id="pravo"><p>
		<div class="otstup2">If you walk around the city legends, then there is the most popular of all, this is the presence of underground passages under the central park. They say</div><div class="otstup"> that it’s possible to cross to the other side of Sozh directly under water, because more than one attack on Gomel was carried out. They also say that the ghost of Count Nikolai Petrovich Rumyantsev walks on them. After his death, he was buried in a crypt above the Cathedral of Saints Peter and Paul. Before World War II, the last time they saw the remains there. During the occupation of the Germans, no one opened the crypt, and after the war, when they opened it, there were no remains there ...
	</div></p></h3>
</br>
		<h3 id="pravo"><p>
		<div class="otstup2">However, experts reject the fact of the existence of moves, they say that in reality there are only almost completely filled up ventilation shafts.</div></p></h3>
	</br>
	<h3 id="pravo"><p>
		<div class="otstup2">Many will now say that no one already believes in these legends and signs, but the noses of the sculptures shine more and more, and while walking in</div><div class="otstup"> the park, you involuntarily wonder: where does this tunnel lead to?</div></p></h3>

	<h1 id="the_story">The story about the appearance of Grodno!</h1>
	    <p><img id="minskfoto" src="img/grodno.png" alt="" align="left">
	 <div id="textalign" class="pravo"><h3><p>
		Grodno has been known since the beginning of the XII century, when the city prince Vsevolod was first mentioned in Russian chronicles. It was then that the city first became known as the center of the City Principality.</p></h3></div></p> 
	</br>
	<h3 id="pravo"><p>
		Grodno was first mentioned in the annals in 1005, however, this message requires thorough verification, since the link is not to the source. The official date of foundation of the city is 1128.</p></h3>
	</br>
	<h3 id="pravo"><p>
		Throughout its history, the city has been the center of various administrative and territorial units of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, the Commonwealth, the Russian Empire, the Soviet Union and independent Belarus. Since 1991, the city has been the regional center of the Republic of Belarus; located near the state border with Poland and Lithuania.</p></h3>
	</br>
	<h3 id="pravo"><p>
		Grodno is one of the oldest cities in the territory of modern Belarus. Archaeological excavations show that at the end of the first and the beginning of the second millennium, the Grodno region was inhabited mainly by the Baltic Yotvags and Lithuania and the Slavic Dregovich expanding their presence; the first Slavic settlements on the territory of the future Grodno appeared in the X century on a high bank at the mouth of the Gorodnichanka and Neman rivers. In the XII century, on the site of these settlements, a city appeared, located at the intersection of trade routes, and initially was a small <div id="plaren">fortress with a fortified trading town.</div></p></h3>
	</br>
	<h3 id="pravo"><p>
		<div class="otstup2">The historical development of the city (known in the Middle Ages as Goroden) is largely due to its geographical location. From the 12th century to the</div><div class="otstup"> present day, the city has always been a border town and has often been used as a border outpost of various state entities. In this regard, the history of the city is closely connected with the military history of the states under whose authority the city was located.</div></p></h3>

		<h1 id="the_story">The story about the appearance of Brest!</h1>
	    <p><img id="minskfoto" src="img/brest.png" alt="" align="left">
	 <div id="textalign" class="pravo"><h3><p>
		BREST is the third oldest city in Belarus after Polotsk-862 and Turov-980.</p></h3></div></p> 
	</br>
	<h3 id="pravo"><p>
		The history of Brest, or Berestya (the first name of the city) begins in 1019, the first mention found in the "Tale of Bygone Years". It was a large, well-fortified settlement. Birch bark residents lived here, and the name of the city ... most likely comes from the word "birch bark" (the outer layer of the birch bark) or from the word "birch bark" (type of elm).</p></h3>
	</br>
	<h3 id="pravo"><p>
		One of the legends of the name of the city - the rich merchant with his comrades went with goods to Lithuania. The caravan made its way off-road through dense forests and thorny bushes until a swamp bog blocked the road ... there was no way to move further, the wheels of the carts were tightly bogged down, the horses could not take a single step.
		Merchants were not accustomed to retreating from their goals - they chopped birch trees, covered the swamp with birch flooring, and the shopping cart crossed the swamp along the unsteady but strong birch path. Near a small river, the caravan stopped to rest. A river not far flowed into a wider river and formed an island with it, densely covered with trees. They thanked the merchants of their pagan god Veles for a safe passage - they built a temple in his honor on the island and moved on. After successful fishing in Lithuanian lands, a convoy with large profits returned. They made a halt at Velesov’s temple, cut down several log huts here and decided to stay forever. They did not forget the difficult path <div id="plaren">through the swamps - they called the new city Berestye ...</div></p></h3>
	</br>
	<h3 id="pravo"><p>
		<div class="otstup2">The name later changed more than once - in the annals there was the name Beresty, and among the inhabitants there was the name Berest, in the</div><div class="otstup"> XVII-early XX centuries the city was called Brest-Litovsk, then Brest nad Bug and only in September 1939 it was called Brest. The main source for studying the history of the ancient Birch Bark is the mention of ancient Russian chronicles. However, in the annals they are quite rare and have the character of short, random, indirect references to the city in connection with other events of more significant significance.
		This is explained by the fact that the city most likely did not have its own annals and did not play a special role in the political life of ancient Russia. The annals did not indicate information about the location of the cities, the layout, their external appearance, buildings, economic and cultural life ... And we will not find such information not only about Berestye but also about the other cities of ancient Russia.Therefore, to update the history of individual cities and regions, it was necessary to use other sources, such as archaeological research of the finds of ancient settlements, cities. The origin of Brest is confirmed by an archaeological site discovered on the territory of the Volyn fortification of the Brest Fortress. At a depth of about 4 meters, up to 30 residential and farm buildings of the Detinets, the central fortified part of Berestye, were uncovered. Now there is the Archaeological Museum "Berestye".The excavation area is more than 1000 square meters. Archaeological research allows us to conclude that Brest arose on the territory of the settlement of the East Slavic tribal association-Dregovich, a detinet appeared at the turn of the X-XI centuries, the Beresteyskoe settlement existed in the XI-XIII centuries.
