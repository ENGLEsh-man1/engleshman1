<h2 class="al2"><div class="al1">There are many attractions in Belarus, but we will tell you only about three of them.</h2>
	<div class="fir"></div>
 <h1 id="mir">Mirskiy Castle</h1>

<p class="fig"><img class="img1" src="img/mir.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h2 class="al4"><div class="al3">From the very beginning of its existence, Mir Castle is surrounded by legends and secrets. For example, the exact</div> date of the start of construction of the castle complex is still not known for certain. There is only an assumption that it began no earlier than 1522 by order of Yuri Ilinich, the owner of these places at that time.</h2>

<h2 class="al4"><div class="al3">
Also, not everything is clear with the goal of building the Mir Castle. There is an opinion that the fortress was</div> erected only for reasons of prestige, since the World at that time was a fairly calm place.</h2>

<h2 class="al4"><div class="al3">
But at the same time, the thickness of the castle walls, in the lower part of which loopholes are cut, reaches 2-3</div> meters. In addition, the north and west walls had battle galleries. All this indicates a good defensive ability of the fortress in case of hostilities.</h2>

<h2 class="al4"><div class="al3">
And nowadays, Mir Castle is surrounded by many legends that create an atmosphere of mystery and, like a</div> magnet, attract tourists.</h2>







	<div class="fir"></div>
 <h1 id="mir">Brest Fortress</h1>

<p class="fig"><img class="img1" src="img/brest3.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h2 class="al4"><div class="al3">Brest Fortress: it was here that fierce battles took place in 41 years. Soviet troops escaped from the German. Now</div> on the walls of this building you can find inscriptions of a similar type: “There were five of us: Sedov, Grutov I., Bogolyubov, Mikhailov, Selivanov V. We took the first battle on 22.VI.1941. We’ll die, but we won’t leave! ”- it is written on the bricks of the outer wall near the Terespol Gate.
</h2>

<h2 class="al4"><div class="al3">
In the western part of the barracks, in one of the rooms, the following inscription was found: “There were three of</div> us, it was difficult for us, but we did not lose heart and die like heroes. July. 1941. "</h2>

<h2 class="al4"><div class="al3">
Many tourists annually visit this tragic place, which played a small role during the war.</h2>




	<div class="fir1"></div>
 <h1 id="mir">Khatyn</h1>

<h2 class="al5">Khatyn: a village that does not exist ...</h2>

<p class="fig"><img class="img1" src="img/atin.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h2 class="al4"><div class="al3">The name of the Belarusian village of Khatyn is known all over the world, although now it no longer exists, since</div> the life of this settlement tragically ended on March 22, 1943. The village was not abandoned by the inhabitants, but died along with people and will never rise from the ashes again.
</h2>

<h2 class="al4"><div class="al3">
The death of this and other Belarusian villages, the death of every fourth Belarusian during the Great Patriotic War</div> was dedicated to the Khatyn memorial complex opened in 1969.</h2>

<h2 class="al4"><div class="al3">
The complex itself is an example of a harmonious fusion of arts, which has no equal in the world in terms of</div> impact on visitors. The embodiment of the spirit of deep sorrow and eternal memory, a symbol of greatness and tragic heroism - that is Khatyn.</h2>
